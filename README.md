# Rendering tools for python

 * rendertools.oculusrift
 * rendertools.gl
 * rendertools.glmatrix
 * Not windows compatible

Oculusrift support might work from scratch on x64 linux. If it doesn't, you can try compile it against the SDK yourself, the script is inside the module.

I've written it on top of pygame, but changing it shouldn't be a hassle. Only the Image and oculusrift -module requires pygame.
